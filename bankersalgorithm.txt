Data structures are used to implement the Banker’s Algorithm:

1) Available
2) Max
3) Allocation
4) Need
5) Process

The algorithm for finding out whether or not a system is in a safe state can be described as follows:

1) Let Work and Finish be vectors of length ‘m’ and ‘n’ respectively.
Initialize: Work = Available
Finish[i] = false; for i=1, 2, 3, 4….n

2) Find an i such that both
a) Finish[i] = false
b) Needi <= Work
if no such i exists goto step (4)

3) Work = Work + Allocation[i]
Finish[i] = true
goto step (2)

4) if Finish [i] = true for all i
then the system is in a safe state
